The web interface uses the SHJS syntax highlighter which is GPL.

You can get SHJS from here: http://shjs.sourceforge.net/

The minified version of shjs is used by the web interface, but is probably
not very good for hacking. The non-minified version is included in this
directory, as is the GPLv2.

The rest of the code in this project is Apache 2 licensed, and **NOT** GPL.
